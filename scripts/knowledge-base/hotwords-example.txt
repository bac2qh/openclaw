# Hotwords Configuration for VibeVoice-ASR
#
# This file provides domain-specific terms (hotwords) to bias transcription accuracy.
# The VibeVoice-ASR model uses these terms to improve recognition of proper nouns,
# technical terms, and project-specific vocabulary.
#
# Format:
#   - One term per line
#   - Blank lines and comments (lines starting with #) are ignored
#   - Multi-word terms are supported (e.g., "Apple Silicon")
#   - Terms are case-sensitive
#
# Usage:
#   1. Copy this file to ~/openclaw/{USER_PROFILE}/config/hotwords.txt (e.g., ~/openclaw/xin/config/hotwords.txt)
#   2. Edit the file to include your domain-specific terms
#   3. The transcribe.sh script will automatically use these terms
#
# Agent-driven updates (via Telegram):
#   - VM path: /Volumes/My Shared Files/{USER_PROFILE}/config/hotwords.txt
#   - Host path: ~/openclaw/{USER_PROFILE}/config/hotwords.txt (same file via shared folder)
#   - Tell agent: "update hotwords: Alice, Bob, ProjectX"
#   - Agent writes to the file, changes take effect on next transcription
#
# Example terms:

OpenClaw
